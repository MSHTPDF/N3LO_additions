# N<sup>3</sup>LO additions

This repository contains the Fortran routines for transition matrix elements and splitting functions up to approximate N<sup>3</sup>LO (aN<sup>3</sup>LO).

Feel free to raise an issue in this space in the event of any questions, requests, comments or bug fixes.

This code is provided as supplementary material to the MSHT20 
approximate N<sup>3</sup>LO PDFs.

These approximations are not exact and allow for a level of 
variation by the input parameter "a" in all cases. These 
subroutines here use a simple method of simultaneous equations in
order to produce the approximations and therefore may well 
be superseded in the future by more robust and equally/more 
efficient approximations or indeed, the exact functions when 
available.

Please refer to arXiv:2207.XXXX for the full details of how these
approximations are determined.

Note that these can and will be continually updated with any  
extra exact calculations that are made available, which will 
increase the accuracy of these approximations.
